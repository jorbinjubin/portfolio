# Hello!
It appears you have found your way over to my portfolio, for whatever reason.
This portfolio was created using SvelteKit and TailwindCSS.
## Navigation
There is a sticky header at the top. The "ICS4U Portfolio" title doubles as a "home" button, whilst the other links lead to their respective pages.
The Quick Navigation menu on the tutorial pages are designed so that you can go to whichever section you want with just one click.
Once you're done, you can use the "back to top" arrow that appears once you scroll down far enough to, well, go back to the top.

## Run Locally
If you want to run this locally for whatever reason, after cloning the repo and installing an up-to-date version of NodeJS, run the following commands:
`npm install` to install the required packages
`npm run dev` to start the development server
