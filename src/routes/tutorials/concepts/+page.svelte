			<h3 class="font-semibold jetbrains text-3xl sm:text pb-5">01. Conditionals</h3>
		</section>
			Conditionals can be used to adjust the flow of a program based on certain conditions.<br />
			To use an if statement, the syntax is as follows:
			<C1 />
			For example:
			<C2 />

			<div class="pb-10" />
			That's fantastic, but what if you also wanted to know if 'i' was not equal to 4? This is where
			the 'else' statement comes in.
			<C3 />
			<div class="pb-18" />
			Finally, to have multiple conditions you want to check for, the 'else if' clause can be used like
			so:
			<C4 />
			<div class="pb-8" />
			There are 2 more ways to write if statements. One is a shortened version, whilst the other is known
			as a ternary statement. All of the following implementations are functionally identical to a regular
			if-else statement.
			<C5 />
			<div class="pb-8" />
		

		<section id="loops">
			<h3 class="font-semibold jetbrains text-3xl sm:text pt-5 pb-5">02. Loops</h3>
			Loops are great for doing related tasks, multiple times. For example - let's say you needed to
			search the contents of 10 lockers. You could do:
			<C10 />
			But what if you needed to search 100 lockers? Or 1000? No trivial copy-paste solution would work.
			Instead, you could use a loop!
			<C11 />
			<div class="pb-3" />
			The other type of loop is a while loop. It executes the contents of the loop as long as the condition
			that is passed to it is true. For example:
			<C12 />
			In this case, the program will end when 'guess' becomes 5, but while loops can go on forever if
			the condition never becomes false, so use them carefully!
		</section>

		<section id="arrays">
			<h3 class="font-semibold jetbrains text-3xl sm:text pt-5 pb-5">03. Arrays</h3>
			Arrays can be used to store multiple values of the same data type efficiently. Suppose you had
			5 eggs of different sizes and you wanted to store those sizes. Instead of storing them as individual
			variables, it would be smarter to store them in an array like so:
			<C6 />
			<div class="pb-10" />
			The entries in the array are called elements (5,6,2,7,9 in the above example) and their places
			in the array are called indices. They interact like so:
			<C7 />
			<div class="pb-10" />
			They can also be iterated through using for- and for-each loops:
			<C8 />
			<div class="pb-10" />
		</section>

		<section id="arraylists">
			<h3 class="font-semibold jetbrains text-3xl sm:text pt-5 pb-5">04. ArrayLists</h3>
			ArrayLists are a Java class that needs to be imported. They are a more flexible version of arrays.
			They allow you to dynamically increase the size, at the cost of extra memory and performance. Their
			basic methods are as follows:
			<C9 />
			An ArrayList will dynamically change its size by doubling it when full.
			<div class="pb-10" />
