				During my time around computers, I have created a number of projects. Below, you will find a list of my favourites.

                <a href="/projects/countrysorting" class="duration-200 text-cyan-500 hover:text-fuchsia-500 ">Country Sorting</a>
            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg pb-5">For this project, the task was to take a list of countries and sort them based on population and area. Due to the many exceptions involved, I used external code to generate the exception if statements.</p>

               Chemical Equilibrium Simulation
            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg pb-5">This project is a simulation I made with my friend Colin to demonstrate the effects of equilibrium on the production of Sulfuric acid. You can find it <a href="https://c4c2.xyz/equib" class="text-cyan-500 hover:text-fuchsia-500"> here</a>.</p>
            <h3 class="font-semibold jetbrains text-3xl sm:text">
                Enter the Gungeon clone
            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg pb-5">
                My first major programming-related project was creating an Enter the Gungeon-style pixel art bullet hell entirely using Scratch, a block-code system developed by MIT. The code was lost in a catastrophic hard drive failure.

                Micro Desktop CNC
            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg pb-5">
               My first go at building a CNC machine from scratch was a machine made for cutting keys for cars. It was designed for specifically BMW-style keys where the majority of the cutting was to be done on the inside, allowing me to make use of 1/8th inch carbide end mills.<br/>
               The machine frame was made of aluminum extrusions filled with epoxy granite, which is a mixture of sand and epoxy resin. This was used to increase mass and dampen vibration, in order to achieve better precision.
               The spindle motor was 500-watt (yes, it's overkill, especially for running 1/8th inch carbide end mills) brushless DC motor.
               The 3 axis were driven using NEMA 17 motors, which is a fairly standard choice offering a good balance between precision and cost.
               It has since been upgraded to use a custom steel frame and stores tool paths locally using a microcomputer.

                Other
            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg pb-5">My other non-programming-related projects involve lots of DIY stuff and woodworking, mostly. I have made over 100 bowls, plates, and scoops thus far.</p>
