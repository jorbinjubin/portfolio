Dear Marcus.

I am very sorry for you. Ethel too. Do know that your family loves you. Ask the warden if he will extend our visit time next Tuesday.
Chris, young as he is, will not understand what is happening. I pray that he will some day. He eventually will know what you did. 
The bad deeds cannot be absolved, but you should still pray for Godâ€™s forgiveness.
The dreaded day is almost here. Time eats away at my resolve. I do ask God every day to ease your suffering. 
Doctor Bradford tells us that it will be quick and painless.
You have so many good qualities. Your heart is pure. You only lack empathy.
I know you are in pain. You must know that the families of your victims also hurt. 
We all hurt. We seek some sort of closure; but a tidy end, all desire, few secure. It could be that you alone will secure it.

Salut my dear son,
Lester.
