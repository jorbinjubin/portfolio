```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClassA a_a = new ClassA();  // This works because a variable of type ClassA can hold an object of type ClassA.
        ClassB b_b = new ClassB();  // This works because a variable of type ClassB can hold an object of type ClassB.
        ClassA a_b = new ClassB();  // This works because ClassB is a subclass of ClassA, allowing you to store a ClassB as type ClassA.

        System.out.println(a_a.getFoo());  // Prints 5, as expected

        System.out.println(b_b.getFoo());  // Prints 5 since it inherits this behaviour from ClassA

        System.out.println(b_b.getBar());  // Prints 7, as expected

        System.out.println(a_b.getBar());  // Causes a Compile-time error. The Java compiler checks 
                                           // for a method in ClassA called "getBar()",
                                           // which fails, causing a compile time error, even though at runtime,
                                           // this code would work just fine 
                                           // since ClassB has a "getBar()" method.

        System.out.println(((ClassB) a_b).getBar());  // Prints 7, after downcasting the variable to type ClassB, 
                                                      // allowing the compiler to find the "getBar()" method.
        
    }
